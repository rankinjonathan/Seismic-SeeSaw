## Pin out

In the current version of the code, this is the pinout, though this can be changed at any time

| Device         | Arduino Pin |
| :------------- | :---------- |
| Yellow Button  | `2`         |
| Blue Button    | `4`         |
| Left Pot       | `A0`        |
| Right Pot      | `A1`        |
| Slide Pot      | `A2`        |
| Force Resistor | `A3`        |
| Solenoid 1     | `8`         |
| Solenoid 2     | `7`         |
| Rapid Solenoid | `~6`        |
| Servo Scraper  | `~9`        |
| Motor 1        | `~3`        |
| Motor 2        | `~5`        |
